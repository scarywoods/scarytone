# scaryplayer
A fast and simple (but widely customizable) versatile media player! Currently supports audio through FFmpeg and SDL2. Other formats will be added eventually (pdf, video, image, and text).


## ROADMAP 

Video playing

Pdf viewer (not epstein, edp445, or the likes)

Text viewing (with markdown support)

Image viewing

Making scaryeditor

Compatibility with scaryeditor (a planned media editor). When scaryeditor is installed in the same path as scaryplayer (dont worry about this if youre installing via AUR / flatpak), it will allow you to seamlessly switch between editing and viewing
